# falcon


This crate contains bindings to the C implementations of the following schemes,
from [PQClean][pqclean].

This project packages Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms that participate in
the [NIST PQC standardization effort][nistpqc]. It is currently a collection of
wrappers around C implementations from the [PQClean][pqclean] project.

## Serialization

If you want `serde` support, enable the `serialization` feature.

## Included implementations from PQClean

Below is a list of the included schemes and the corresponding implementations
sourced from [PQClean][pqclean]. The "default" implementation is used in the
Rust-friendly interface, alternative implementations are exposed as ``ffi``
methods only.

* ``falcon-512``
  * ``clean``
  * ``avx2`` (if supported)
  * ``aarch64`` (if supported)
* ``falcon-1024``
  * ``clean``
  * ``avx2`` (if supported)
  * ``aarch64`` (if supported)
