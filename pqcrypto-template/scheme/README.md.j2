{% if insecure %}
    This (implementation of an) cryptographic algorithm is insecure.
    This crate will only compile if you enable the "cryptographically-insecure" feature.

    Only use this crate and algorithm for research and educational purposes.
{% endif %}

This crate contains bindings to the C implementations of the following schemes,
from [PQClean][pqclean].

This project packages Post-Quantum cryptographic algorithms that participate in
the [NIST PQC standardization effort][nistpqc]. It is currently a collection of
wrappers around C implementations from the [PQClean][pqclean] project.

## Serialization

If you want `serde` support, enable the `serialization` feature.

## Included implementations from PQClean

Below is a list of the included schemes and the corresponding implementations
sourced from [PQClean][pqclean]. The "default" implementation is used in the
Rust-friendly interface, alternative implementations are exposed as ``ffi``
methods only.

{% for scheme in schemes %}
* ``{{ scheme.name }}``
{% for implementation in scheme.implementations %}
{% if implementation == 'avx2' or implementation == 'avx' or implementation == 'aesni' or implementation == 'aarch64' %}
  * ``{{ implementation }}`` (if supported)
{% else %}
  * ``{{ implementation }}``
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}{# implementations #}
